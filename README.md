In this assignment we perform an analysis of Taxis in NYC. In particular, we are curious to answer to some specific *research questions* (__RQs__) that may help Taxi drivers in planning their movements throughout the city and the Taxi's users to have hints about the convenience of enjoying this service.

For this purpose we use the open data of Taxi's trips in NYC. In order to answer to the *RQs* we take into account the data related to Yellow cab for the year 2018.

## Files
Here you find the list of task you need to perform before running the analysis.

1. We have downloaded [Yellow cabs data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) (2018) and we have also downloaded the `taxi_lookup_zone.csv`. It should have the same name as I have given to run the files correctly for RQ1 and RQ4. 

You can the see all questions answers in above file.

Let us know what do we need to improve. 
Thanks.
